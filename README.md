# flatiron-cli-ok
Encapsulated logic for showing command status in flatiron CLI apps

## Installation
```
npm install flatiron-cli-ok
```

## Usage
At its core `flatiron-cli-ok` is a broadway-compatible plugin which can be used by any [flatiron](https://flatironjs.org) cli application

```js
var flatiron = require('flatiron')
  , app = flatiron.app;

app.name = 'app.js';

app.use(flatiron.plugins.cli, {
  usage: 'A simple CLI app using flatiron-cli-ok'
});

app.use(require('flatiron-cli-ok'));

app.start();
```

If you run the above script

```
âž¤ node app.js
```

The output will start with

```
info:   Welcome to app.js
info:   It worked if it ends with app.js ok
```

The output will end with

* If the command executed successfully

```
info:   app.js ok
```

* If the command executed unsuccessfully

```
info:   app.js not ok
```

### IMPORTANT

__You have to call the callback in the command, if you want this plugin to show the status__
